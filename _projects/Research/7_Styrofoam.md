### Overview

The Styrofoam Podcast was the result of a short course on Instructional Design in February 2019. 

Season 1 consists of 5 episodes, each about various aspects relevant to the Common Entrance Exam for Design or CEED.

As part of a group of 10 M.Des students, I worked on creating the content and scripting the podcasts. I also helped record and produce the final episodes, and appeared as a speaker on 4 of them.

As of November 2019, the episodes as a whole have had over 10,000 plays on Soundcloud. You can check them out below:
