As part of a course on Design for Virtual Reality, we developed a VR application to help novice musicians gain a visual intuition for music theory concepts like harmony and scales. As part of a team of 3 students (Maulashree, Amarnath and me), we created the virtual environments which consisted of visual landscapes that responded to a player's musical input. We mapped the physical position and scale of the real electronic keyboard to the virtual environment, and used the Leap Motion sensor to allow players to see their hands in VR.
