### Overview

As part of the course "Trends in Interactive Technologies", I worked on a project investigating the impact of realistic speech synthesis technologies on the world over the next few decades. As part of the project, I wrote a short science fiction story, and excerpt from a fake research paper, and built a few electronic prototypes to accompany the narrative. The overarching story was one of a world where all speech is suspect. The prototypes and artefacts are included below.

### Artefact 1

An excerpt from "ReVoice: Assistive Speech Synthesis through Semi-Autonomous Artificial Intelligence" by R. Finneman, B. Korg and M. Patel.

### Artefact 4

The Compass - a portable tool to indicate real or fake voices in the space around us. It works by vibrating more intensely when pointed at a source of speech that is more likely to be fake.
