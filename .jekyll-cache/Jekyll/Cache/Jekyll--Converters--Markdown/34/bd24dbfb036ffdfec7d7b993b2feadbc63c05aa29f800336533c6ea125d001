I"~<p>Expresso was an Interactive Installation created for TypoDay 2019.</p>

<p>We created an ‘expressive typewriter’, where the strength and pressure of a key-press directly influenced the thickness and width of the resultant glyph on screen.</p>

<p>We built the typewriter on top of two MIDI electronic keyboards (to be able to capture the key-press pressure), and used the MIDI messages to render different types of a <strong>[<em>Variable Font](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/testdrive/demos/variable-fonts/)</em></strong> through a JavaScript file.</p>

<p>Initally, the setup looked something like this:</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Eventually, the keyboards came together and looked a bit cleaner:</p>
