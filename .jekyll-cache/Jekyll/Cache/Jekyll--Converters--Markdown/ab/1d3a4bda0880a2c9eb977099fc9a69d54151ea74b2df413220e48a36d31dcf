<p>Creating a comics based on campus life was an idea that had been with me for quite some time. An initial attempt at realising the same can be found here - <strong><em><a href="https://bipolarspectacles.wordpress.com/">Bipolar Spectacles Wordpress</a></em></strong> - an old blog I put up for the purpose.</p>

<p>In my final year, I was able to expand upon the idea and create a book compiling a series of comic panels and stories. The final version of this book, as of December 2017, can be viewed below.</p>
