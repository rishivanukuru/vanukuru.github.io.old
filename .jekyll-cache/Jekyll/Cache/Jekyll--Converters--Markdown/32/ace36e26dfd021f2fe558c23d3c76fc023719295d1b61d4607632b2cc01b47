<p>As part of my Major Degree Project, I worked on research into the applications of biological computational models to multimodal transport network design. A research publication regarding the same titled <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-77538-8_8"><strong><em>‚ÄúMultimodal Transportation Network Design Using Physarum Polycephalum-Inspired Multi-agent Computation Methods.‚Äù</em></strong></a>, can be found in the proceedings of the International Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation 2018.</p>

<p>An overview of the work is given in the following poster.</p>
